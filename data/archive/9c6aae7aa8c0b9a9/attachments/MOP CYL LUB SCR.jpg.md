## Content

The image shows an industrial control panel UI on a monitor, titled 'Auxiliaries > Cylinder Lubrication' with the 'Main' tab active. It displays several operational readouts: 'Total Cyl. Oil' 144,242 L; 'Flow l/h' 10.3; 'LCD' Off; 'Nominal Feedrate' 0.95; 'Part Load Control' Power. The main area contains seven vertical gauges (labels 1–7) representing 'Actual Feed Rate' with numeric presets above each gauge (1.00, 1.15, 1.00, 1.15, 1.20, 1.00, 1.20) and a corresponding 'Feed Rate Factor' row showing values like 1.00, 1.15, 1.00, 1.15, 1.20, 1.00, 1.20. A 'Running In' row shows Off for each channel. Other sections show input-like values: 'Feed Rate Factor' 0.28 g/kWh, 'Fuel Oil Sulfur' 3.40%, 'Break Point' 40, 'Min. Feed Rate' 1.00 g/kWh, 'Prelube' Off. The bottom-right shows Enable LCD: Enabled. The right-side column contains a vertical navigation menu with sections such as Engine, Auxiliary, Hydraulic System, Scavenge Air, Cylinder Lubrication, Maintenance, Admin. The date/time at the top-right reads 2025-03-13 08:52:43. Overall, this is a meaningful operational diagram rather than decorative imagery.
