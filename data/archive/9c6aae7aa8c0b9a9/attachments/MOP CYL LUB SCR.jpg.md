## Content

The image shows a detailed industrial control panel / dashboard from an engine lubrication system. At the top it reads Auxiliaries > Cylinder Lubrication with a timestamp (2025-03-13 08:52:43). The main area contains several numeric readouts and controls: Total Cyl. Oil 144,242 L; Flow l/h 10.3; Nominal Feedrate 0.95; Part Load Control Power; multiple vertical gauges labeled 1–7 displaying Actual Feed Rate (values like 1.00, 1.15, 1.20, etc.) and corresponding Feed Rate Factor values (also around 1.00–1.20). Rows include Feed Rate Adjust Factor and Running In [g/kWh], mostly Off or specific values. The bottom section shows Input parameters such as Feed Rate Factor 0.28 g/kWhS%, Fuel Oil Sulfur 3.40%, Break Point 40, Min. Feed Rate 1.00 g/kWh, Prelube Off, and Enable LCD (Enabled). There’s a side panel with system category labels (e.g., Engine, Hydraulic, Scavenging Air) indicating a larger machine interface. Overall it’s a screenshot containing substantive technical data rather than decoration.
