## Content

A screenshot of an industrial control panel (HMI) for cylinder lubrication. The header reads 'Auxiliaries » Cylinder Lubrication' with a active 'Main' tab. The top-right shows a timestamp '2025-03-13 08:52:43'. Key metrics include 'Total Cyl. Oil 144,242 L', 'Flow l/h 10.3', 'LCD Off', 'Nominal Feedrate 0.95', and 'Part Load Control Power'. There is a row of seven vertical gauges labeled 'Actual Feed Rate [g/kWh]' with values such as 1.00, 1.15, 1.00, 1.15, 1.20, 1.00, 1.20, each with corresponding 'Feed Rate Factor' buttons (1.00, 1.15, 1.00, 1.15, 1.00, 1.00, 1.20). The 'Running In [g/kWh]' indicators appear as Off for several columns. The lower section 'Input' shows fields like 'Feed Rate Factor 0.28 g/kWhS%', 'Fuel Oil Sulfur 3.40 %', 'Break Point 40', 'Min. Feed Rate 1.00 g/kWh', 'Prelube Off', and a status 'Enable LCD Enabled'. A right-hand vertical menu with categories (e.g., Engine, Auxiliary System, Hydraulics) is visible. Overall, this is a data-rich control screen rather than a decorative image.
